                      <p>This is my wife, my rock, my better half. I have had the priviledge to know her for a decade. We have been married for 3 years of that decade. She is my main support, motivated me to push forward on my dreams and never thought it was too late to pursue any of my crazy ventures. She is 27 years old and is pursuing a career in Accounting. She is close to finishing and like me she goes to Fresno City College. She was born in Fresno and raised in Madera like me. We met playing one of our passions, soccer. She has played since she was 6 and she almost made it as a professional but she chose motherhood and career over that.</p>

                      <hr>
                      <p>Born on September 14 of 2017, he is my oldest. He really is a miracle. I have type 1 Diabetes and I had a lot of doctors tell me over the years that I may never be a father due to my underlying disease. We had tried for so long and we had given up hope. He really came out of nowhere. He is a smart, curious and shy boy. Once you get him going he is funny and a silly kid. He is the closest to me in personality compared to his mother.</p>

                      <p>My youngest boy, and he too was a surprise. He came almost right after his brother. Turns out that once you are able to conceive children once, after that it becomes much much easier. He has more of his mothers personality I think, but I keep getting told he has my stubborness and determination. He is definitely much louder than my oldest and he has a short fuse. I love his spunk and his determination a lot.</p>
