    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello my name is Julian Mireles, I would like to take the time and let you know a little about me. I was born in Fresno, CA, but was mainly raised in Madera, CA. I was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes at the age of 10; two weeks before my 11th birthday and 2 days before my moms' birthday. I am now 30 years old, so I have had this disease for about 20 years already. I love sports, mainly Soccer and Football. I love anime and anything really with japanese culture. I love technology and I love building computers from scratch. I enjoy learning and expanding my knowledge of things. We only live once and we have to try to make the most of it. 
        </p>

    <h1>Some Interests of Mine...</h1>
        <p>
            I have a family and I don't have much time it seems at the present. I do have some interests that I would at some point like to explore and maybe get better at. These are things that I am not familiar with or good or very limited in knowledge in skill, but I would like to pursue some practice in.
