          My name is Julian Mireles, born in Fresno, CA and raised my whole life in the streets of Madera, CA. I am a son to two Mexican parents, who raised a two sons, me bieng the oldest of two. They have instilled upon me the belief that hard work pays off. It sounds cliche and it may be so, but it is the truth. Nothing in this life is free, we must reach out and obtain it. We must earn and work for the future we want. Against all adversity they were able to allow for me to pursue my career aspirations and my dreams. That no quit attitude is what leads me to pursue new goals and ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes at the age of 10, which has led me to grow up fast. The normal life of a child changed. It allowed me learn responsibiilty and discipline. I use it as a strength and motivator to keep on pushing forward, because tomorrow is never promised. With the support of my parents and now the support of my beautiful wife, it has not derailed me from my hopes and ambitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love and enjoy watching and playing Soccer. I also love Football and Mixed Martial Arts. Amongst the many things I like, I am a huge Anime fan and I also love building and fixing computers. I am a big believer in enjoying as much time with your family as you can. I am a deep thinker and complex individual but I am simple and minimal as well. I enjoy the small things in life and admire the more complex things as well.

            I enjoy this so much, the hunt for the parts needed the process of building something out of nothing. Running software to see how powerful it is and then looking to sell or gift it to someone. It takes me to a place of peace and calm.

        <p>
          When time permits I love recording and editing content for my Youtube channel. This is fun because I get to play video games and get to edit the videos. The whole process is fun and allows me to grow as a person.

        <p>
          I love soccer so much it was my first passion. In my spare time I follow Manchester United and European soccer. I love to study tactics and the history of the game, in hopes of doing some in depth coaching in the future.
